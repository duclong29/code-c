    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <p>
        The <i>cottge garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design,dense plantings,and a
        minture of<br />ornamental and edible plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u>and its history can be traced back for centuries, although
        they were re-inventd<br />in 1870's England,when styized versions were formed as a reaction to the more
        structured and rigorously maintained <u>english estate gardens</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earliest cottage gardebs were more practical than their modem descendants,with an emphasis on
        vegetables and herbs,along with some fruit trees.
