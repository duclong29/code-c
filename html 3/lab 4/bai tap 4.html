<p>A potager is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden.Often flowers (edible
and non-edible)and herbs are<br />planted with the vegetable to enhance the garden's beauty.The
goal is to make the function of providing food aesthetically</p>
<h2>what to plant</h2>
<p>Plants are chosen as much for their function as for their color and form.Many are trained
to grow upward.A well-designed <br />potager can provide food,cut flowers and herbs for the home
with very little maintenance.Potagers can disguise their function of<br />providing for a home in a wide
array of forms-form the carefree style of the cottge gerden to the formality of a knot garden.</p>
